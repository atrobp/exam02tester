# Read me

After seeing some of us struggle to get the exam done, i've decided to create this--
The purpose of this is not to copy and paste the code from the expected folder, but instead test your own and see if it match, all the code in there are handmade and if you do not understand what i've written that is intended.

# How does it work?
Tester will compile both your and my code and see if there's a difference -- if there's = KO else OK; Simple as that

# What kind of test it is done?
I tried to include test done by the moulinette during the exam aswell as random personnal test. If you get an OK, but KO in the exam let me know :)

#how to setup
Clone the repo and add your .c file in their respecting level in rendu folder followed by a make command
