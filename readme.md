# Read me

After seeing some of us struggle to get the exam done, i've decided to create this--
The purpose of this is not to copy and paste the code from the expected folder, but instead test your own and see if it match, all the code in there are handmade and if you do nott understand what i've written that is intended.

# How does it work?
Tester will compile both your and my code and see if there's a difference -- if there's = KO else OK; Simple as that
